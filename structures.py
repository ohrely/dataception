# Dictception
# create a dictionary of dictionaries.
# each team member is a key in the base dict.
# at each level, the dreamer's value is a dict of the team members on that level.
# build recursively?


# Graphception



# Treeception



# Stackception
# dreamers' experience of dream order.
# some variable better be named non_rien_nest_rien.



# Queueception



# Linkception
# doubly-linked list of dream order.
# why doubly linked?  because dreamers have to kick back out of the dreams in order.
